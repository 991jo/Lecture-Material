# Master Thesis Suggestions

---

## General Remark

- There are rarely explicit topic suggestions online
- Thus, ask and discuss
- Applies to all *"IPVS sim groups"*: SGS (Schulte, Jaust), SC (Pfl√ºger), and US3 (Uekermann)

---

## Classical Types of Topics

Various different types of topics are possible:

- Focus on **numerical methods**
    - e.g. new data mapping method in preCICE
- Focus on **applications**
    - e.g. applying preCICE in new application field
- Focus on **HPC**
    - e.g. load balancing for macro-micro-coupled problems

All such topics require *"SSE skills"*, but also some simulation background (SimTech or lectures from SGS/SC/US3).

---

## Pure SSE Topics

... are also possible and do not require much simulation background.

Examples:

- New approaches to multi-component (multi-software) tests
- Mock testing for middle layers (e.g. preCICE adapters)

---

## Continuing with your Challenge Software?

There are always interesting topics concerning preCICE adapters:

- DuMuX
- FEniCS
- OpenFOAM
- ...

There are also ongoing collaborations on how to integrate preCICE with other tools:

- pyiron
- pyMOR

---

## More

- If you have a good idea for a contribution to the SSE lecture, this could also be a topic.
