## Poll on First 5 Weeks

- Thanks for participating!
- Many wrote that they liked the concept. Made us very happy. :blush:
- **Multiple sources of content (website, GitLab, GitHub)**
    - We are aware of the problem and are thinking about solutions.
    - Reason 1: you should learn GitLab + GitHub
    - Reason 2: private information (GitLab) vs. public information (GitHub)
    - In general: lecture on GitHub, challenge on GitLab
- **Exercises too much workload**
    - You are not expected to finish within the exercise session (50% done is good).
- **Git exercise and VM/containers lecture need improvement** -> YES
- Demo challenge presentation by lecturers?
    - We are thinking about it.
